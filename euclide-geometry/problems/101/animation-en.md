## Problem 003: Cyclic Quadrilateral with Perpendicular Diagonals

### Problem
Quadrilateral $ABCD$ is inscribed in a circle with center $O$, and $\overline{AC} \bot \overline{BD}$.
Prove that the polygonal line $AOC$ bisects the area of quadrilateral $ABCD$.

## Geometry Information
V(deg:r) means point V is the point (r, 0) rotated by deg degrees in the standard direction (counterclockwise).

Center of the plane O, circle centered at O with radius 2,
Point A(110:2), B(160:2), C(-110:2), D(20:2),
Segments AC and BD,

## Problem Phases

**PHASE 1: Quadrilateral ABCD**

- Display points A, B, C, D (duration: 0.2s)
- Draw quadrilateral ABCD @ 0.3s (duration: 1.5s)

---

**PHASE 2: Draw Segments Connected to Center**

- Draw diagonals AC and BD as dashed lines (duration: 1.2s)
- Draw four segments from center O to A, B, C, D simultaneously @ 1.3s (duration: 1.0s)
- Display point O @ 2.0s (duration: 0.2s)

## Solution Phases

**PHASE 1: Equal Area Transformation**

- Move vertex O of triangle AOG to the midpoint of segment BD (maintaining triangle shape) (duration: 1.0s)
